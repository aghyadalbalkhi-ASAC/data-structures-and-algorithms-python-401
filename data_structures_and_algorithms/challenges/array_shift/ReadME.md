# Shiftting an Array
*its about Shiftting the elements of array after insert a element in the middel of Array for example :*

[4,8,15,23,42] and The Value to Be Inserted Is [16] `before Insert`

[4,8,15,16,23,42] `After Insert`


# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

*shifting the elements after inserting the elements in specific position*

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

*Create a Function that takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.*

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- get the Length of Array 
- get the index of the middel of that array 
- loop over the array and append the elements to the new one
- do a special case for the middel index to insert the value
- return the New array
