*find an element in a stored array in low complexity time cost*

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

*check if the string is balnced or not*

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

*Create a function that take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced.*

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- stack list
- looping through the string 
- check the open bracket  and push it to stack
- for the close bracket pop from stack
