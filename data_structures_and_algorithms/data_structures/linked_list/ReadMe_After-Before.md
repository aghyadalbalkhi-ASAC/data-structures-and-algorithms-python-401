# LinkedList
*Create  a Linked List that contain  append and insertAfter,insertBefore methods* 


# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

*Adding Node from after or before a node with specific value *

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

*Create a  Insert after method Take value and new value as an arguments then create a node to insert this node after a node with specific value*
*Create a  Insert before method Take value and new value as an arguments then create a node to insert this node before a node with specific value*
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### append
- reach to last node
- add the new node at the last

### insert_After

- determine the target node with specific value
- link the new node with the the next node of target value
- link link the target node to the new node

### insert_before

- determine the target node with specific value
- link the new node with the the next node of target value
- link link the target node to the new node
