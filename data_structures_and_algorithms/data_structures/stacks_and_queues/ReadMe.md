# Stacks and Queues

*Create a stack and queues classes with them method*

*pop() - push() - peek()*

*enqueue - dequeue - peek()* 


# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

*dealing with pointers top and front and rear*

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

*create stack and queue with thire methods*

## Stack
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### push
- check if empty
- adding node and changing the pointer


### pop
- check if empty
- delink the node from the stack and return the value

### Queue

### Enqueue
- check if empty
- adding node and changing the pointer of the rear


### Dequeue
- check if empty
- Deleting node and changing the pointer of the front

- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
- [x] Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
- [x] Can successfully enqueue into a queue
- [x] Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
- [x] Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
- [x] Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
- [x] Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
- [x] Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
