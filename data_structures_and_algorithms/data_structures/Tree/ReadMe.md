# BinaryTree
*Create a Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree with their common methods*

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

*dealing with recursive  and add Node in the correct place to keep tree balanced*

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

*create Node class*
*create Binary Tree*
*create Binary Search Tree*

### add 
- accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree

### contains  
- accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once

- [x] Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
- [x] Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
- [x] Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
