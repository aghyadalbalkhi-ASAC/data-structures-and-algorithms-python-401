# Reverse an Array
its about reversing the elements of array for example :

[1,2,3,4] it will be after  reversing [4,3,2,1]

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create a method that take an array as a parameter and return the same reversed array

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
create an empty array and loop over the original one and push the elements from the end to a new array

The Big O > O(n)*2
